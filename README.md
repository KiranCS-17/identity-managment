# Context Based Identity-Managment Methods

**Abstract**
The idea proposes a new method for mobile and immobile asset protection and life cycle management using network assisted and network provided events.
The method to 
	1.Generate mobility and communication context events
	2.Store communication context event data
	3.Generate a Hash Tag based on stored event data
	4.Authorize group users to acquire hash tags for multiuser authentication
	5.Induced/Virtual roaming for relative events

Events can be location events or device state events or mobile context events specific to device or relative to device.
Are specific to these domain 

1.	IoT: Smart City
2.	General Public: Protecting/Monitoring the assets 
3.	Government/Private Body: Protecting/Monitoring the assets
4.	Context Based Resource Authorization and Authentication
5.	Context Based Identity Management.

Some mobility Event Examples
1.	Location Events (Real, Induced)
2.	User state Event (Real, Induced)
3.	Roaming Events (Real, Induced)
4.	Re-Attach Event (Real, Induced)
5.	Detach Event (Induced)
6.	Relative Attach Event (Real)
7.	OAM events
8.	Charging Events
9.	Attach from type of network event
10.	Attach from specified Device event
11.	Receive SMS event
12.	Send SMS event 
13.	Subscribe for SMS event.
14.	Generate email event
15.	Get Charging event.
16.	Handover from RAT (inter/intra) events
17.	Handover from different access events
18.	Using multiple SIMs from multi-vendor operator related events
19.	Events due to OTT

**Realization**
Via Example:
 [Via Example](https://github.com/KiranCS-17/identity-managment/blob/main/figure-1.png)
  E1, E2: Location Events generated by Devices 
  S1, S2: Location Events generated by RANs w.r.t source.
  S3, S4: Location Event Generation control by cloud core
  S5: Event store with specific pattern.

  Vicinity-Vr is the case of roaming by the same device D1 of the CUG.
